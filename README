Prints out this help message.



OPTIONS:
 -b     use the branches, can not be used with -t (tags) option. Used with -u
        [svn update] or -w [svn switch].

 -c     Do not use the wp-config.php file to grab the database user name and
        password. Default is to use the wp-config.php file. Scipt always uses
        wp-config.php to get the database name unless the -d flag is used.

 -d     supply the database name to use. Use only when updating a single
        install

 -f [/path/to/filename]
        path to a file containing a list of paths to WordPress installs, can
        not be used with -i (single install) option. File must consist of full
        paths in the form "/wwwroot/sites/mossiso.com/blog/" each on a separate
        line. A ";" semi-colon designates a commented line. If file exists in
        the directory you are running wpupdate from, then only the filename is
        needed.

 -h     display this help info

 -i     path to  a single WordPress install. Can not be used with -f (versions file)
        option 

 -k     skip backing up the wp-content folder and database

 -m     Set the temp path, /tmp by default.

 -n     run as a normal user, do not use sudo

 -o [/path/to/filename]     
        path to output file containing report of svn update. File will be
        created if it does not exist. The directories must already exist. The
        default is to save it to your home directory.

 -p     turn off the steps to secure and protect WP. Steps include removing
        the install.php file, adding rules to the htaccess file to protect
        the wp-config.php file, the .svn directories, and the
        wp-content/uploads directory. These steps are done by default.

 -v     outputs version information and exits

 -V [#.#]
        The WordPress version number used for the upgrade/downgrade.

 -r     output the default SVN repo used and exit

 -s [http://svn.url.com]
        svn URL to use for updates (defaults to http://core.svn.wordpress.org).
        Used with -u [svn update] or -w [svn switch].

 -u     use "svn update", can not be used with -w (switch) option. Required for
        SVN update, default is to use WordPress latest.zip and cp command.

 -w     use "svn switch", can not be used with -u (update) option. Required for
        SVN update, default is to use WordPress latest.zip and cp command.

 -t     use the tags, can not be used with -b (branches) option. Used with -u
        [svn update] or -w [svn switch].

 -x     skip fixing permissions and owners


WHAT IT DOES:
    First the wpupudate program makes a backup copy of the MySQL database and
    the wp-contents/ directory. It places these backups in a temporary
    directory.
    

THINGS TO KNOW:
    By default the program runs as sudo. To run as normal user, pass the -n
    flag. This user must have absolute privileges over all files in the
    WordPress installation directory.

    The location is updated to the latest version of WordPress by default, use
    the -V flag to change the WordPress version.

    If the -f or -i flags are not given on the command line, the program will
    attempt to update the current directory.

    The script attempts to use the wp-config.php file for MySQL database
    account and connection information. If it can not find the information, the
    script prompts for a MySQL user and password.

    The script saves a copy of the downloaded WordPress version in the home
    directory when run without sudo, or in the /tmp directory when run with
    sudo (default), so that subsequent calls to the script use the already
    downloaded version.
